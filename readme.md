### **1. Control Flow and Conditional Logic**

**Documentation Requirement:**  
Explain why specific jump instructions were chosen and how they impact program flow.

**Answer:**  
- **Jump Instructions Used:**
  - **`je` (Jump if Equal):** This instruction is used to handle the case where the number is `ZERO`. After comparing the input with `0` using `cmp`, `je` ensures the program jumps to the code block that handles `ZERO` when the comparison result is equal.
  - **`jl` (Jump if Less):** This instruction is used to classify the number as `NEGATIVE`. It checks if the input is less than `0` and jumps to the `NEGATIVE` handling block.
  - **`jmp` (Unconditional Jump):** This is used to redirect the program flow after completing a classification. For instance, once the number is classified as `POSITIVE`, the program uses `jmp` to skip over the other branches and exit.

- **Impact on Program Flow:**  
  These jump instructions allow the program to evaluate the input in a structured and efficient manner. Conditional jumps like `je` and `jl` help classify the input based on conditions, while `jmp` ensures the program doesn't unnecessarily execute other branches after determining the classification.

### **2. Array Manipulation with Looping and Reversal**

**Documentation Requirement:**  
Comment each step of the reversal process and explain challenges with handling memory directly.

**Answer:**  
- **Reversal Process Steps:**
  1. **Initialization:** Two pointers (`ebx` and `ecx`) are initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively.
  2. **Looping:** A `cmp` instruction checks if the pointers have crossed or met. If not, the loop continues.
  3. **Swapping:** The values at the two pointers are swapped using temporary registers (`eax` and `edx`).
  4. **Pointer Update:** The left pointer (`ebx`) is incremented, and the right pointer (`ecx`) is decremented to move towards the center of the array.

- **Challenges with Handling Memory Directly:**
  - **Memory Alignment:** Direct manipulation of memory requires ensuring that addresses are properly aligned for 32-bit integers.
  - **Avoiding Buffer Overflows:** Care must be taken to ensure pointers do not exceed array bounds, which could lead to memory corruption.
  - **In-Place Reversal:** The program must avoid using additional memory, so all operations are performed on the same memory locations, which can complicate logic.

### **3. Modular Program with Subroutines for Factorial Calculation**

**Documentation Requirement:**  
Document how registers are managed, particularly how values are preserved and restored in the stack.

**Answer:**  
- **Register Management:**
  - **Preserving Registers:** Before performing any operations in the factorial subroutine, the `push` instruction is used to save the current values of `ebx` and `ecx` on the stack. This ensures that these registers are not overwritten during the computation.
  - **Restoring Registers:** At the end of the subroutine, the `pop` instruction restores the original values of `ebx` and `ecx` from the stack, ensuring the calling function's state remains unaffected.
  
- **Stack Usage:**
  - The subroutine uses the stack to store intermediate results and to maintain proper register values.
  - The `ebp` register is used as a base pointer to manage the stack frame during the function call, ensuring clean parameter passing and return.

- **Result Placement:**  
  The final result of the factorial calculation is placed in the `eax` register, which is a general-purpose register commonly used to return values in x86 assembly.

### **4. Data Monitoring and Control Using Port-Based Simulation**

**Documentation Requirement:**  
Explain how the program determines which action to take based on the “sensor” input and how memory locations or ports are manipulated to reflect the motor or alarm status.

**Answer:**  
- **Determining Actions Based on Sensor Input:**
  - The sensor value is read from a simulated input port (a memory location).
  - **High Threshold:** If the sensor value exceeds the high threshold, the program triggers the alarm by setting the `alarm_status` memory location to `1`.
  - **Low Threshold:** If the sensor value is below the low threshold, the program turns on the motor by setting the `motor_status` memory location to `1`.
  - **Moderate Range:** If the sensor value is between the thresholds, the program turns off the motor by setting `motor_status` to `0`.

- **Manipulating Memory Locations:**
  - The memory locations `motor_status` and `alarm_status` simulate hardware control:
    - Writing `1` to these locations represents turning on the motor or triggering the alarm.
    - Writing `0` represents turning off the motor or resetting the alarm.
  - These values are updated conditionally based on the sensor input, ensuring that the program reacts appropriately to different water levels.

- **Challenges:**
  - Simulating ports in memory requires careful alignment and management of memory locations.
  - Ensuring that the program responds to edge cases (e.g., sensor value exactly at the thresholds) requires precise conditional logic.
