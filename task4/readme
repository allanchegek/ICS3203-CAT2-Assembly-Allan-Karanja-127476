# Data Monitoring and Control Using Port-Based Simulation (32-bit Assembly)

This program simulates hardware-like data monitoring and control using port-based I/O operations in x86 32-bit assembly.

---

## **Program Details**
- **File Name:** `task4.asm`
- **Platform:** 32-bit Linux (x86 architecture)
- **Purpose:**
  - Read simulated data from an input port.
  - Process the data and apply predefined rules.
  - Write control signals or processed data to an output port.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Assembler:** [NASM](https://nasm.us/) (Netwide Assembler)
2. **Linker:** `ld` (part of GNU Binutils)
3. **Environment:** A 32-bit Linux system or a 64-bit Linux system with `libc6-i386`.

---

## **Compiling and Running the Program**
### **Steps to Run**
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `task4.asm`.

2. Assemble the program:
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf32 task4.asm
   ```

3. Link the object file to create an executable:
   ```bash
   ld -m elf_i386 -o task4 task4.o
   ```

4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./task4
   ```

## **How the Program Works**
1. Simulates reading data from a virtual input port.
2. Processes the data based on specified conditions.
3. Outputs the processed data or control signals to a virtual output port.

---

## **Code Highlights**
- **Port Simulation:** Uses memory-mapped I/O simulation to emulate hardware ports.
- **Data Processing:** Implements conditional logic to process incoming data.
- **Syscalls:** Outputs results to the console.

---

## **Example Run**

#### Input Data:
```
Simulated input: 0xF3
```

#### Output:
```
Processed Output: 0xA5
```

## **Challenges and Insights**
1. **Port-Based Simulation**:
   - Mimics hardware behavior using memory-mapped I/O.
2. **Conditional Logic**:
   - Processes data according to predefined rules.
3. **32-bit Architecture**:
   - Utilizes 32-bit registers for efficient data handling.
